While carrying everyday items like a kitchen knife as a tool is generally allowed (if used properly), carrying a knife (or any item) for the purpose of using it as a weapon can be illegal. Defensive weapons (including pepper spray intended for self\u2010defense) are subject to rules that generally restrict their possession and use by the public.\n\nIn short, there isn\u2019t a free-for-all list of \u201citems anyone may carry\u201d in Canada; most restrictions pertain to items that can be used as weapons, often with heavy regulation if approved use is permitted at all.",
